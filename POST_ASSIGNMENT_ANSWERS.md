## Post-Assignment Questions

### 1. Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.

One important element that I focused on when building the app was responsiveness. Within the mobile view, I chose to display the mood log underneath the animation container and add a horizontal slider.

I was also keen to keep the code structure as clean and readable as possible, so I separated each of the components into its own folder, and structured the components so each one had its own functionality and shared functions.

### 2. How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

- 2 hours - Researching
- 4 hours - Animating
- 5 hours - Coding
- 2 hours - Debugging

**Total time:** 13 hours

### 3. If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

I would advise myself to spend more time exploring Motion's capabilities - I went straight into building the app, whereas if I had spent more time testing the way the software interacts with SVGs, I would've realised it was not possible to animate the background during the mood transition. I overcame this issue by integrating gsap to perform this function, but it cost me time to find this solution.

### 4. Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

Yes, the animation portion allowed me to showcase my problem-solving skills, my ability to learn new software quickly, and my design intuition. I was also able to showcase my React knowledge.

### 5. Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise?

Given that this was a take-home assessment, I wasnâ€™t able to demonstrate my strong communication and collaboration skills.
